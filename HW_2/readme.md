Here's a breakdown of the problem-solving flow in list items:

## **Problem Analysis Flow**

### **1. Understand the Mark 6 Rules**
- Draw 7 unique numbers from 1-49
- First 6: official drawn numbers
- Last number: extra number
- Prize structure based on matches:
  - 6 matches: 1st prize
  - 5 matches + extra: 2nd prize
  - 5 matches: 3rd prize
  - 4 matches + extra: 4th prize
  - 4 matches: 5th prize
  - 3 matches + extra: 6th prize
  - 3 matches: 7th prize

### **2. Break Down into Sub-Problems**

#### **Part A: Prize Calculation**
- **Input**: User's entry numbers + Draw numbers with extra
- **Process**:
  1. Validate inputs (6 numbers each, range 1-49, no duplicates)
  2. Count matching numbers between entry and drawn numbers
  3. Check if extra number matches any entry number
  4. Determine prize category based on match count and extra number
- **Output**: Prize category and amount

#### **Part B: Draw Simulation**
- **Input**: Random seed (optional)
- **Process**:
  1. Set random seed for reproducibility
  2. Generate 7 unique random numbers from 1-49 using `np.random.choice`
  3. Sort numbers in ascending order
  4. Split into first 6 (drawn) and last (extra)
- **Output**: Tuple of (drawn_numbers, extra_number)

#### **Part C: Total Prize Calculation**
- **Input**: List of multiple entries
- **Process**:
  1. Simulate one draw (using Part B)
  2. For each entry, calculate prize (using Part A)
  3. Sum all prize amounts
  4. Display results for each entry
- **Output**: Total prize money

### **3. Implementation Steps**

#### **Step 1: Set Up Core Functions**
```python
# 1. Prize calculation function
def calculate_prize(entry, draw_data)

# 2. Draw simulation function  
def simulate_draw(seed)

# 3. Total prize calculator
def calculate_total_prizes(entries, seed)
```

#### **Step 2: Input Validation Logic**
- Check list lengths (6 numbers for entries)
- Verify number range (1-49)
- Ensure no duplicates in entries
- Validate data types (lists, tuples)

#### **Step 3: Matching Algorithm**
```python
# Count matches between entry and drawn numbers
matching_count = len(set(entry) & set(drawn_numbers))

# Check extra number match
extra_matched = extra_number in entry
```

#### **Step 4: Prize Determination**
- Use if-elif chain to check all prize conditions
- Return prize name, amount, and match count

#### **Step 5: Random Number Generation**
```python
# Use required numpy functions
np.random.seed(1834633)  # For reproducibility
numbers = np.random.choice(np.arange(1, 50), size=7, replace=False)
sorted_numbers = np.sort(numbers)
```

#### **Step 6: Error Handling**
- Wrap each function in try-except blocks
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Handle edge cases (invalid inputs, wrong types)

### **4. Testing Strategy**

#### **Test Case 1: Example from Problem**
```python
entry = [11, 21, 22, 24, 32, 44]
draw = ([11, 21, 22, 25, 32, 44], 38)
# Expected: 3rd prize (5 matches)
```

#### **Test Case 2: Known Seed Results**
```python
np.random.seed(1834633)
# First draw should be: ([2, 5, 14, 15, 39, 43], 49)
```

#### **Test Case 3: Specific Winning Case**
```python
entry = [2, 14, 18, 20, 39, 41]
# With seed 1834633, should win 7th prize ($40)
```

### **5. Output Requirements**
- Format numbers with commas for currency
- Display both prize category and amount
- Show matching counts for transparency
- Structure output to match example format

### **6. Integration Flow**
```
User Input
    ↓
validate_entries()
    ↓
simulate_draw() → generate 7 numbers → sort & split
    ↓
calculate_prize() → count matches → determine prize
    ↓
calculate_total_prizes() → sum all prizes
    ↓
Formatted Output

This breakdown ensures each component is solved systematically before integration into the final solution.
